<h2>Inner Peace</h2>
<aside class="credits">Music: Sitzman/Headrick<br>Lyrics: Sitzman</aside>
<p>Staring through the wall, just thinking about the other side<br>
I put these thoughts in my head that’d blow your mind</p>
<p>Since we went up, I haven’t come down<br>
Just living day by day until it comes crashing down<br>
I jam out here and that’s my free release<br>
I guess I’m just searching for inner peace</p>
<p>Well if you see me sitting here, you better<br>
Stop on down and we’ll have a beer</p>
<p>Sit down in the chair, release all your cares<br>
Feel the blood flow from your toes to your hair<br>
Enjoy free release, go find Inner Peace<br>
I’d kick start my mind but I don’t own those keys</p>
<p>-Instrumental Break-</p>
<p>Since we went up, I haven’t come down<br>
Just living day by day until it comes crashing down<br>
I jam out here and that’s my free release<br>
I guess I’m just searching for Inner Peace</p>
<p>Stop what you’re doing, just try to relax<br>
Feel the drums and the strings hit you like an axe<br>
Lay low and calm your mind<br>
Start thinking thoughts, come on believe me that it’s no crime</p>
