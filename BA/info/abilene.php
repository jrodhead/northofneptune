<p>Oh, Abilene<br>
I keep wriing for the cause, though I fear it’s lost<br>
Oh, Abilene<br>
One day I’ll seek the chance to resurrect my past<br>
All your living, dying, hoping, crying all the world<br>
All the world they left behind<br>
So I’m living, dying, hoping, crying all the world<br>
All the world I’ve left behind</p>
<p>Hey babe, you’re walking tall, you’re going far<br>
Did you need somebody, did you feed somebody?<br>
Now that you’re on your on your own, are you alone?<br>
Or have your finally found yourself?</p>
<p>Oh, Abilene<br>
Today’s society makes me cry, I'd rather watch it die<br>
Oh, Abilene<br>
What’s happening to our youth?<br>
We’ve grown too old to tell the truth<br>
People living, dying, hoping, crying all the world<br>
All the world has left them behind<br>
So I’m living, dying, hoping, crying all the world<br>
All the world I’ve left behind</p>
<p>Hey babe you’re walking tall, you’re going far<br>
Did you need somebody, did you feed somebody?<br>
Now that you’re on your on your own, are you alone?<br>
Or have your finally found yourself?</p>
<p>I, I read the news today, oh boy<br>
Lennon, Luther, Kennedy’s were shot.<br>
Tell me people that you haven’t forgot!<br>
But with evil leaders' solutions to war<br>
And the implications that Jesus dated a whore<br>
Do you really think that our children are raised right<br>
Or just learning how to put up a fight?</p>
<p>Hey babe I’ll be your man, I’ll take your hand<br>
I’m gonna lead you through the night<br>
But I hope that you will love me too<br>
Because I need you, I need your loving tonight</p>
