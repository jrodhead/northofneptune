		<h3>New Single: Girl Next Door</h3>
		<div class="date">posted 6.12.12</div>
		<p>North of Neptune wants to get inside your earhole and massage your brain with their indie pop glory. You haven't heard this one before, but it'll take you to familiar places. It takes you on a trip back to the street where you grew up and tells a story about the one you knew was trouble. And you liked it.</p>
		<p>Check it out <a href="girlnextdoor.php">here</a>. If you dig it, snag a download from <a href="http://northofneptune.bandcamp.com/track/girl-next-door">our bandcamp page</a>.</p>
