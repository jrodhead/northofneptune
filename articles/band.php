	<p>Based out of Lincoln, NE, North of Neptune is a musical collaboration between Jason Sitzman (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Jared 
	Headrick (lead guitar, producer). Lifelong friends that met in grade school, the duo began writing music together in 2005. They 
	launched North of Neptune in 2011 on a mission of melodic creation and liberation formed within a cosmic soup of indie pop, folk, 
	funk and hints of electronic. Working out of a basement studio made up of used office cubicle walls, the pair have crafted a versatile 
	new sound that is refreshingly original and danceable, yet somewhat familiar due to being based on solid songwriting. In 2012, the 
	hard-working team wrote, recorded, and produced their debut EP that was released on their self-made website, www.northofneptune.com.</p>
