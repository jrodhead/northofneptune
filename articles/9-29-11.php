	<p>We're happy to announce that we're moving out of	the basement and onto a stage for the first time! We will be special guests 
	for Higher Empathy Movement and the Bourbon Theatre on 9/29/11. Will we blow minds or fail miserably? Who knows?! Either way - 
	we promise to entertain, if only for half an hour or so! Show is 9/29/11 and starts at 9pm.</p>
