	<p style="width:55%;float:left">A glorious unity between man and machine. Much more punctual than your average drummer! This setup makes it possible for two ordinary guys like ourselves to be able to play a show without worry about actual people filling in for the rhythm section. Who needs people when you have machines that keep perfect time, right?! Well... we do, but we make due with what we have anyway. If you think you have what it takes to make this band more human, <a href="mailto:northofneptune@gmail.com">send us an email</a> and show us what you've got!</p>
